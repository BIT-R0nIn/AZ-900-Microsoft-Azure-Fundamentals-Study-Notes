# Minimizing Azure costs

## Perform Cost Analyses

- Plan your Azure solution wisely
- Consider the products, services, and resources you need and read their documentation well
- calculate your projected costs by using the Azure Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculators

## Monitor usage with Azure Advisor

- identifies unused or under-utilized resources
- implement its recommendations by removing unused resources
- configure resources to match your actual demand

## Use Spending Limits feature

- help prevent you from exhausting the credit on your account within each billing period 
- spending limit feature is not available for customers who aren't using credit-based subscriptions

## Use Azure reservations

- Azure reservations offer discounted prices for products and resources
- to get a discount, you reserve products and resources by paying in advance
- only available to Enterprise or CSP customers and for Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions

## Choose low-cost locations and regions

- costs vary across regions and locations, if possible use regions with lower costs 

## Cost Saving Offers

- Be up-to-date about Azure customer and subscription offers 
- switch to offers which provide highest cost saving benefit

## Apply tags to identify cost owners

- you can apply tags to groups of Azure products and resources to organize billing data
- you can use tags to categorize costs by department (IT, HR, Finance, etc.) or environments (Production, Test, etc.)
-  Tags make it easy to identify groups that generate the biggest Azure costs
