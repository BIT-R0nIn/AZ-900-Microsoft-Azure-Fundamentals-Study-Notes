# Azure Products and Services

Azure provides purchase options to three types of customers
1. Enterprise- they sign an Enterprise Agreement with Azure to pay a negotiated annual fee. They also have access to customized fees.
2. Web direct- they pay public prices for Azure resources, and their monthly billing and payments occur through the Azure website.
3. Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP)- Microsoft partner companies that a customer hires to build solutions on top of Azure.

- resources are always charged upon usage
- at the end of each monthly billing cycle, the usage values will be charged to your payment method and the meters are reset

## Factors affecting Costs

- when you provision a resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource
- the meters track the resources' usage
- each meter tracks a specific type of usage
- each meter generates a usage record that is used to calculate your bill

Factors affecting cost include,
- resource type
- services
- user location

**Resource type**- the usage that a meter tracks correlates to a quantity of billable units. Those are charged to your account for each billing period, and the rate per billable unit depends on the resource type you are using.

**Services**- usage rates and billing periods can differ between Enterprise, Web Direct, and CSP customers. Different billing structures exist between Azure first-party and third-party products and services 

**Location**- Azure infrastructure is globally distributed, and usage costs might vary between locations that offer Azure products, services, and resources.
