# Azure Subscriptions

- an Azure subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services and allows you to provision resources.
- it is a logical unit of Azure services that links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Azure AD or in a directory that an Azure AD trusts
- an account can have one subscription or multiple subscriptions with different billing models and access-management policies

You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources.

1. Billing boundary-
- determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure.
- multiple subscriptions for multiple billing requirements
-  can generate separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.

2. Access-control boundary-
- Azure will apply access-management policies at the subscription level
- you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures (different departments)
- this allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions

## Creating additional Azure subscriptions

- new subscriptions can be created for resource or billing management purposes
- you might want to create subscriptions to separate environments, organizational structures, and billing purposes
- subscriptions created for billing purposes are used to manage and track costs based on your needs
- additional subscriptions might also be needed due to limitations within subscriptions(ex: Route circuits per subscription is 10)

## Customizing billing 

- if you have multiple subscriptions, you can organize them into invoice sections
- each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that month
- you can set up multiple invoices within the same billing account by creating multiple billing profiles 
- each billing profile has its own monthly invoice and payment method
