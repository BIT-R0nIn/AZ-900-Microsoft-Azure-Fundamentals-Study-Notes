**Capital Expenditure**- are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings or equipment. These expenses are then deducted over time. The value of the up front cost declines over time

**Operational Expenditure** - This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

In simpler terms, CapEx leaves with you something you "keep" and can "resell" (equipment, a building you own). OpEx is something you use up either immediately or soon, and on a somewhat regular basis (supplies like staples or paper, rent payments).

## CapEx Costs

1. **Server Costs**- Includes the cost of hardware components and their maintenance costs.
2. **Storage Costs**- Includes the cost of storage hardware and the cost to support it. 
3. **Network Costs**- Includes the cost of all on-premises hardware components, including cabling, switches, access points, and routers. This also includes wide area network (WAN) and Internet connections.
4. **Backup and archive costs**- Includes the cost to backup, archive, and copy data. Options include setting a back to or from the cloud. There's an upfront cost for the hardware and additional costs for backup maintenance and consumables, like tapes.
5. **Organization continuity and disaster recovery site**- Along with server redundancy and fault tolerance your plan should also include a data recovery site. If a data recovery site is built, it will incur both CapEx (hardware) and OpEx (electricity bills)
6. **Datacentre infrastructure costs"** - These are costs for construction and building equipment, as well as future renovation and remodeling costs that may arise as demands grow. Additionally, this infrastructure incurs operational expenses for electricity, floor space, cooling, and building maintenance.
7. **Technical Support** - While not a capital expenditure, the personnel required to work on your infrastructure are specific to on-premises datacentres. You will need the technical expertise and workforce to install, deploy, and manage the systems in the datacentre and at the data recovery site.

## OpEx Costs

1. **Leasing software and customize features** - As soon as the provider provisions resources, the billing starts. It is your responsibility to de-provision the resources when they aren't in use so that you can minimize costs.
2. **Scaling charges based on usage/demand instead of fixed hardware or capacity** - cloud computing can be billed in multiple ways uch as the number of users or CPU usage time. However, billing categories can also include allocated RAM, I/O operations per second (IOPS), and storage space. Plan for backup traffic and data recovery traffic to determine the bandwidth needed.
3. **Billing at user or organization level** -The subscription (pay-per-use) model is a computing billing method that is designed for both organizations and users. The organization or user is billed for the services used, and typically on a recurring basis (consumption-based model).
## Pros of CapEx

- expenses are planned out an fixed and you know how much you will pay and for what before purchasing. Good for a limited budget scenario.

## Pros of OpEx

- with OpEx, companies wanting to start a new business or grow their business do not have to incur up front costs to try out a new product or service for customers. Instead, they can get into a market immediately and pay as much or ask little for the infrastructure as the business requires. They also can terminate that cost if and when they need to.
