## What is a cloud deployment model?

A cloud deployment model defines where your data is stored and how the customer interacts with it. It also depends on how much of your infrastructure you wan or need to manage.

## Types of cloud deployment models

1. Public cloud- owned by cloud service providers (ex: Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform). Provides cloud resources and services to organizations and users via a secure connection usually over the Internet. All the resources are owned and managed by a third party (usually the cloud service provider), the customer just utilizes them. 

2. Private cloud - owned and operated by the organization that uses the resources from that cloud.  The cloud environment is implemented within the organization's datacentre and provides self-service access to internal users. The organization is the owner of the cloud, and is responsible for all the operations they provide.

3. Hybrid cloud- combination of both the public and private cloud models.

|       **User**       |                     Multiple organizations & users                     |                 Internal users of the  organization                |                           both internal and external users  access up to various levels                          |
|   **Connectivity**   |                        Connect over the Internet                       |                  Connect using the private network                 |           Public cloud is accessed over the Internet, while the private cloud uses the private network           |
|   **Public Access**  |          Services and resources are  available for the public          |                      No access to the public                       |                                      Some services can be accessed publicly                                      |
|      **Skills**      | Does not require deep  technical knowledge to setup  and use resources | Requires deep technical  knowledge to set-up, manage, and maintain | Technical skills are required to maintain  the private cloud, and to connect both cloud models for functionality |
| **Use case example** |                 quick deployment of a website or a blog                |       host medical records and other  sensitive data in-house      |       hosting a website in the public cloud  while connecting it to a secure database  in the private cloud      |
