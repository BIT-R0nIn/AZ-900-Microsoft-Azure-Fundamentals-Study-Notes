# Pros & Cons of the Cloud Models

## Public Cloud

|                                   Pros                                  |                                                      Cons                                                      |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                           No capital expenses                           |                    Certain security requirements cannot  be met by using the  public cloud                     |
|      Agile. Applications can be deployed  and deprovisioned easily      | Certain government policies, industry  standards, and legal requirements cannot  be met using the public cloud |
|      Consumption-based payment model.  Pay for what you only use.       |           The user or organization do not own  the hardware, or services, and cannot manage it freely          |
|   Updating and maintaining infrastructure  is not your responsibility   |      Certain specific scenarios (such as legacy support) may not be compatible with public cloud services      |
| In depth skill is not required to deploy  and use public cloud services |                                                                                                                |

## Private Cloud

| Pros                                                                              | Cons                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total control over the resources                                                  | Upfront capital expenditure                                                                           |
| Full control over the security                                                    | Not very agile. Underlying infrastructures  need to be purchased and setup before  they are leveraged |
| Best option if high security and legal  requirements and compliances are present. | Updating and maintaining resources is your  responsibility                                            |
| Can be built to support specific scenarios (such as legacy application support)   | High technical skills are required to build  and deploy the private cloud                             |


## Hybrid Cloud

|                                                           Pros                                                          |                                              Cons                                              |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                           Flexibility (the organization can  decide where an application runs)                          |               Upfront capital expenditure is required  to implement private cloud              |
|       Cost. The economies of sale feature from the  public cloud can be used for services or  resources you wish.       |  Cost. Purchasing and maintaining a private cloud along with a public cloud can  be expensive  |
|                          The organization will have access to  resources they have control over                         | A deep knowledge and skillset is needed to  maintain a private cloud along with a public cloud |
|               The organization will have access to resources for  which they are responsible for security               |      Proper guidelines must be implemented to avoid confusion,  complications, and misuse      |
|   The organization maintain the ability to comply with  strict security standards, compliance, and legal requirements   |                                                                                                |
| Maintain the ability to support specific scenarios (ex: connect legacy application to public cloud for  authentication) |                                                                                                |
