**Capital Expenditure**- are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings or equipment. These expenses are then deducted over time. The value of the up front cost declines over time

**Operational Expenditure** - This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

In simpler terms, CapEx leaves with you something you "keep" and can "resell" (equipment, a building you own). OpEx is something you use up either immediately or soon, and on a somewhat regular basis (supplies like staples or paper, rent payments).
