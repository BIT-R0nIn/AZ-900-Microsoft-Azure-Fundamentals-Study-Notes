- it is a cloud-based identity and access management service
- it helps users to access internal (apps on the local network) and external (MS 365) resources

Azure AD provides many services such as,

- ***Authentication***- This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources, and providing functionality such as self-service password reset, multi-factor authentication (MFA), a custom banned password list, and smart lockout services.
- ***Single Sign-On***- Enables users to remember only one ID and one password to access multiple applications.
- ***Application Management***- You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps using Azure AD Application Proxy, single sign-on, the My apps portal (also referred to as Access panel), and SaaS apps
- ***Business-to-Business Identity Services***- Manage your guest users and external partners while maintaining control over your own corporate data
- ***Business-to-Client Identity Services***- Customize and control how users sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles when using your apps with services
- ***Device Management***- manage how your cloud or on-premises devices access your corporate data

Azure AD is intended for,

- IT administrators- Administrators can use Azure AD to control access to apps and their resources, based on your business requirements.
- Developers- Developers can use Azure AD to provide a standards-based approach for adding functionality to applications that you build (ex: adding SSO functionality)
- Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office 365, Azure, or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online subscribers- these subscribers are already using Azure AD. You can immediately start to manage access to your integrated cloud apps using Azure AD

## Single Sign-On

- the more identities a user has to manage, the greater the risk of a credential-related security incident.
- password policies vary between applications and as complexity requirements increase, the user will have a hard time remembering their credentials
- managing these identities also become difficult (password resets, account lockouts, authorizing)
- with SSO users only need to remember one ID and one password
- access across applications is granted to a single identity tied to a user
- this simplifies the security model making it easier for users to manage identities and increase the security capabilities in your environment

**SSO with Azure AD**
- multiple data sources can be combined into an intelligent security graph
- this graph enables the ability to provide threat analysis and real-time identity protection to all accounts in Azure AD
- by using a centralized identity provider, you'll have centralized the security controls, reporting, alerting, and administration of your identity infrastructure.
