# Authentication vs Authorization

When it comes to identity and access, authentication and authorization underpin everything else and occur sequentially in any identity and access process.

## Authentication (AuthN)

- the process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a resource
- it involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials and provides the basis for creating a security principal for identity and access control use (it affirms if they are who they say they are)

## Authorization (AuthZ)

- the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has.
- it specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it
