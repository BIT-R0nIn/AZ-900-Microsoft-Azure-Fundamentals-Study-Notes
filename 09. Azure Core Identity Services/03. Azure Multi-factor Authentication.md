# Azure Multi-factor Authentication

## What is multi-factor authentication?

Multi-factor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification, such as to enter a code on their cellphone or to provide a fingerprint scan rather than just authenticating using a username and password. 

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication works by requiring two or more of the following authentication methods:

1. Something you know- typically a password
2. Something you have- trusted device that is not easily duplicated, like a phone or hardware key
3. Something you are - biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan

- MFA increases identity security by limiting the impact of credential exposure
- to fully authenticate, an attacker who has a user's password would also need to have possession of their phone or their fingerprint, for example.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) comes as part of the following Azure service offerings:

- Azure Active Directory premium licenses- provide full-featured use of Azure MFA Service (cloud) or Azure MFA Server (on-premises)
- Multi-factor authentication for Microsoft 365
- Azure Active Directory global administrators- these accounts are very critical, so MFA is provided for added security
