# Microsoft Trust Center

Microsoft trust Center is a website resource containing information and details about how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services, and provides support and resources for the legal and compliance community.

The Trust Center provides information on,
- in-depth information about security, privacy, compliance offerings, policies, features, and practices across Microsoft cloud products
- recommended resources in the form of a curated list of the most applicable and widely used resources for each topic
- information specific to key organizational roles, such as data security teams and legal compliance teams
- cross-company document search, which is coming soon and will enable existing cloud service customers to search the Service Trust Portal.
- direct guidance and support for when you can't find what you're looking for.
