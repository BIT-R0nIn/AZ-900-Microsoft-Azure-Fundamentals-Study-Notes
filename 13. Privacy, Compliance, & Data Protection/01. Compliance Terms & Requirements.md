# Compliance Terms & Requirements

When selecting a cloud provider to host your solutions, you should understand how that provider can help you comply with regulations and standards. Some questions to ask about a potential provider include:

- How compliant is the cloud provider when it comes to handling sensitive data?
- How compliant are the services offered by the cloud provider?
- How can I deploy my own cloud-based solutions to scenarios that have accreditation or compliance requirements?

The Microsoft compliance framework for online services maps their controls to multiple regulatory standards, which enables Microsoft to design and build services using a common set of controls. These controls streamline compliance across a range of today's regulations as they continue to evolve in the future.
