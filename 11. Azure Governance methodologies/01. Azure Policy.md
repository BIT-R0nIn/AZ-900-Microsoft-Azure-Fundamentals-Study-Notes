- it is an Azure service that allows you to create, assign, and, manage policies
- these policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, this allows resources to stay compliant with your corporate standards and service-level agreements (SLAs)
- Azure Policy does this by using policies and initiatives
- it runs evaluations of your resources and scans for those not compliant with the policies you have created

- Azure Policy comes with a number of built-in policy and initiative definitions that you can use, under categories such as Storage, Networking, Security Center, Compute, and Monitoring.
- Azure Policy also can automatically remediate resources and configurations that are deemed non-compliant, thus ensuring the integrity of the state of the resources. 

## Implement Azure Policy

There are three steps when it comes to creating and implementing Azure policy

1. **Creating a policy definition**
- it expresses what to evaluate and what action to take.
- for example, you could prevent VMs from being deployed if they are exposed to a public IP address
- every policy definition has conditions under which it is enforced & has an accompanying effect if the conditions are met

ex: *Allowed storage account SKUs. This policy definition has a set of conditions/rules that determine whether a storage account that is being deployed is within a set of SKU sizes. Its effect is to deny all storage accounts that do not adhere to the set of defined SKU sizes.*

2. **Assign a definition to a scope of resources**
- to implement your policy definitions, you assign them to resources.
- a policy assignment is a policy definition that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope (management group, resource group etc.)
- policy assignments are inherited by all child resources, unless you exclude the sub-scopes explicitly

3. **Review the policy evaluation results**
- when a condition is evaluated against your existing resources it is marked compliant or non-compliant
- policy evaluation happens about once an hour
