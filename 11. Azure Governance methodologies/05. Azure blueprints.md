- used to design and deploy a repeatable collection of Azure resources that adhere to certain requirements and standards.
- quickly build and deploy new environments that are always compliant with organizational standards
- it is a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts, such as role assignments, policy assignments, Azure Resource Manager templates, and resource groups
- also useful in Azure DevOps scenarios, where blueprints are associated with specific build artifacts and release pipelines and can be tracked more rigorously

## Blue Print process

- the process of creating an Azure blueprint consists of the following high level steps

1. Create blueprint
2. Assign blueprint
3. Track blueprint assignment

- unlike Azure Resource Manager templates, there exists an active relationship between the blueprint and the deployed resources
- maintaining relationships, in this way, improves auditing and tracking capabilities.
