# Subscription Governance

There are mainly three aspects to consider in relation to creating and managing subscriptions,
1. **Billing**
2. **Access Control**
3. **Subscription limits**- the maximum number of Express Route circuits per subscription is 10. Consider that,when deciding. If there is a need to go over those limits in particular scenarios, then additional subscriptions may be needed
