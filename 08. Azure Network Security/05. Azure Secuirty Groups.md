# Azure Security Groups

## Network Security Groups

- allow you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network
- can contain multiple rules that filter traffic to & from resources by source and destination IP, ports, and protocols

### Network Security Rule Properties

- ***Name***- unique name on network security group
- ***Priority***- number between 100-4096. Lower the number, higher the priority
- ***Source or Destination***- IP address(es) or IP address range, service tag, or application security group
- ***Protocol***- TCP/UDP/any
- ***Direction***- specify for inbound or outbound traffic
- ***Port Range***- individual port or port range
- ***Action***- Allow or Deny

- when a NSG is made, Azure creates defaults NSGs to provide baseline security
- these cannot be deleted but can be overridden by new NSGs with higher priorities

## Application Security Group

- enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure
- this allows you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups
