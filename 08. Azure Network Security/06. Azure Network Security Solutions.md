# Azure Network Security Solutions

## Perimeter Layer

***focus on identifying these attacks, alerting, and eliminating their impact***
- use Azure DDoS Protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for end users
- use perimeter firewalls with Azure Firewall to identify and alert on malicious attacks against your network

## Network Layer

***focus on limiting communications, only allow what is needed. Segment your resources and apply network access controls***
- limit communication between resources through segmenting your network and configuring access controls
- deny by default
- deny inbound Internet access and limit outbound where necessary
- implement secure connectivity to on-premise networks

## Combined Services

- combine multiple Azure networking and security services to manage your network security and provide increased layered protection

Example:

1. ***Azure Firewall & Network Security Groups***- NSGs provide distributed network layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources within virtual networks in each subscription. Azure Firewall provides network and application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.
2. ***Application Gateway WAF & Azure Firewall***- WAF is a feature of Application Gateway that provides your web applications with centralized, inbound protection against common exploits and vulnerabilities. Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols (for example, RDP, SSH, FTP), outbound network-level protection for all ports and protocols, and application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S
