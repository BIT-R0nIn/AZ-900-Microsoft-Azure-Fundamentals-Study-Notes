# Azure DDoS Protection

## What is a DDoS attack?

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks attempt to overwhelm and exhaust an application’s resources, making the application slow or unresponsive to legitimate users
- DDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the Internet

## Azure DDoS protection

- leverages the scale and elasticity of Microsoft’s global network to bring DDoS mitigation capacity to every Azure region
- for best protection Azure DDoS protection must be joined with application design best practices
- protects your Azure applications by scrubbing traffic at the Azure network edge before it can impact your service's availability
- Azure recognizes the attacker's attempt to overwhelm the network and blocks further traffic from reaching Azure services 
- legitimate traffic from customers still flows into Azure without any interruption of service

## Protection Service Tiers

1. **Basic Tier**
- automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform
- always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks
- Azure’s global network is used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across regions

2. **Standard Tier**
- provides additional mitigation capabilities that are tuned specifically to Microsoft Azure Virtual Network resources
- simple to enable and requires no application changes
- protection policies are tuned through dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms
- policies are applied to public IP addresses which are associated with resources deployed in virtual networks

The following types of attacks can be mitigated by the Standard Tier level protection,

1. Volumetric attacks- The attacker's goal is to flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic
2. Protocol attacks- These attacks render a target inaccessible, by exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack
3. Resource (application) layer attacks- These attacks target web application packets to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts
