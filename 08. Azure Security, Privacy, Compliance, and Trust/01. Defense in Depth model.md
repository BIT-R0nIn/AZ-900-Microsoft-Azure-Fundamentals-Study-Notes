# Defense in Depth

- Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to data
- objective of defense in depth is to protect and prevent information from being stolen by individuals not authorized to access it
- the three main principles of a security posture is **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**

**Confidentiality**-  The principle of least privilege restricts access to information only to individuals explicitly granted access. 

**Integrity**- The prevention of unauthorized changes to information at rest or in transit.

**Availability**- Ensure services are readily available to authorized users.

- each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further exposure
- this approach removes reliance on any single layer of protection

## Data

- in almost all cases, attackers are after data
- it's the responsibility of those storing and controlling access to data to ensure that it's properly secured
- there are regulatory requirements that dictate the controls and processes that must be in place to ensure the CIA of the data

## Application

- ensure applications are secure and free of vulnerabilities
- store sensitive application secrets in a secure storage medium
- make security a design requirement for all application development
- developers should make security requirements non-negotiable

## Compute

- the focus in this layer is on making sure your compute resources are secure
- proper controls must be set in place to minimize security issues
- systems must be patched and updated and endpoint security must be implemented

## Networking

- limit communication between resources (only allow what is required)
- deny by default
- restrict inbound Internet access and limit outbound, where appropriate
- implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks

## Perimeter

- focus on protecting from network-based attacks against your resources
- identify attacks, eliminate impact, and send alerts (DDOS protection)

## Identify & Access

- ensure identities are secure and access is only allowed to what is needed
- control access to infrastructure and change control
- use SSO and MFA
- audit events and changes

## Physical Security

- physical building security and controlling access to computing hardware within the data center is the first line of defense
- the intent is to provide physical safeguards against access to assets
- safeguards ensure that other layers can't be bypassed, and loss or theft is handled appropriately
