# Azure Firewall

## What is a firewall?

- a firewall is a service that grants server access based on the originating IP address of each request
- firewall rules are implemented that specify ranges of IP addresses
- only clients from these granted IP addresses will be allowed to access the server
- firewall rules also include specific network protocol and port information

- Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based, network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources
- it is a fully stateful firewall-as-a-service with built in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability
- You can create, enforce, and log, application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions, and virtual networks
- it uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources, so outside firewalls can identify your traffic
- fully integrated with Azure monitor for logging and analytics

**Azure Application Gateway also provides a firewall, called the Web Application Firewall (WAF). WAF provides centralized, inbound protection for your web applications against common exploits and vulnerabilities.**
