- Security Center can be used in the first 3 stages of IR 

1. **Detect** - Review the first indication of an event investigation. For example, use the Security Center dashboard to review the initial verification that a high-priority security alert was raised.
2. **Assess**- Perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity. For example, obtain more information about the security alert.
3. **Diagnose** - Conduct a technical investigation and identify containment, mitigation, and workaround strategies. For example, follow the remediation steps described by Security Center in that particular security alert.

## Enhance security

- You can reduce the chances of a significant security event by configuring a security policy, and then implementing the recommendations provided by Azure Security Center

**Security Policies and Recommendations**

- A security policy defines the set of controls that are recommended for resources within that specified subscription or resource group.

- Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources
- when it comes across a potential vulnerability, it creates recommendations based on the controls set in the security policy
