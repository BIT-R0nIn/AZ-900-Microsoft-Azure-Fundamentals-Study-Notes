# Application SLAs

- Azure customers can use SLAs to evaluate how their Azure solutions meet their business requirements and the needs of their clients and users
- By creating your own SLAs, you can set performance targets to suit your specific Azure application

When creating application SLAs the following must be considered,

- **identifying workloads**- To ensure that application architecture meets your business requirements, define target SLAs for each workload
- **plan for usage patterns**- Identify differences in requirements during critical and non-critical periods,
- **establish availability metrics**- use MTTR and MTBF to determine where to add redundancy and to determine SLAs for customers 
- **establish recovery metrics**- conduct a risk assessment and understand the cost and risk of downtimes and data loss in your organization.
- **implementing resiliency strategies**- Implement resiliency design patterns, such as isolating critical resources, using compensating transactions, and performing asynchronous operations whenever possible
- **Build availability requirements into your design**- avoid single points of failure, decompose workloads by service-level objective, and throttle high-volume users.

*MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)- average time it takes to restore a component after a failure.*
*MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)- how long a component can reasonably expect to last between outages*
*RTO (Recovery Time Objective)- maximum acceptable time an application can be unavailable after an incident*
*RPO (Recovery Point Objective)- maximum duration of data loss that is acceptable during a disaster*

## Resiliency

- Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- it's not about avoiding failures, but responding to failures in a way that avoids downtime or data loss
- the goal is to return the application to a fully functioning state after a failure
- **High availability** and **disaster recovery** are two crucial components of resiliency
- when designing your architecture for resiliency you should perform a Failure Mode Analysis (FMA)

*FMA is used to identify possible points of failure and to define how the application will respond to those failures*

## Cost, Complexity, & High Availability

- Availability is the time a system is up and running
- to maximize availability measures must be implemented to prevent failures and downtime
- such measures result are difficult, costly, and complex to implement
- as systems grow in complexity it is possible to overlook failure points (specially with interdependent services)
- the risk of potential downtime is cumulative across SLAs
- the more complex your solution, the greater the challenges to implement high availability
- Therefore, how critical high-availability is to your requirements will determine how you handle the addition of complexity and cost to your application SLAs.
