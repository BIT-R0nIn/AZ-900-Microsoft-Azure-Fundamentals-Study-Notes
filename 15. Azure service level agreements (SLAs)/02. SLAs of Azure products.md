# SLAs for Azure products or services

- an SLA defines the performance targets for an Azure service
- these performance targets are specific to each Azure service
- these performance targets are expressed as uptime, connectivity rates, response times etc.

- **performance targets range from 99.9% to 99.99%**

## Service Credits

SLAs also describe how Microsoft will respond if an Azure product or service fails to perform to its governing SLA's specification. 
For example, customers may have a discount applied to their Azure bill, as compensation for an under-performing Azure product or service.
