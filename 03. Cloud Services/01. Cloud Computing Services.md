# Cloud Computing Services

There are three main types of cloud computing services,

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Most basic type of category of cloud services
- In IaaS, IT infrastructure such as servers, virtual machines, network, storage, and operating systems are rented from the cloud service provider.

With IaaS
- there is no upfront cost,
- the user is responsible for purchasing, configuring, and managing their own operating systems, middlewares, and applications.

IaaS usage
- Migrating workloads (move existing apps to the cloud)
- Deploying test and development environments (quicker deployment of applications)
- website hosting (easier and economical)
- storage, backup, and recovery (saves money, scalable, no need for IT staff to manage)

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- PaaS provides an environment to build, test, and deploy software applications.
- The goal of PaaS is to help create an application as quickly as possible.
- The customer doesn't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure (operating system included)
- PaaS provides a completely managed platform to run applications

With PaaS
	- there is no upfront cost
	- the user is responsible for running and testing their applications.
	-the cloud service provider is responsible for providing the complete platform for the user's application to run on. 

PaaS Usage
	- Development framework for cloud applications
	- Business and data analysis


## Software as a Service (SaaS)

- SaaS provides end users with centrally hosted and managed software.
- Users can access these cloud applications over the Internet.

With SaaS
	- there is no upfront cost, users follow an annual or monthly subscription plan.
	- the user doesn't own or manage the software, they can simply access and use it over the Internet.
	- the cloud service provider holds responsibility for the whole underlying structure and the software.

SaaS usage
	- email, calender, and office tools. ex: Microsoft Office 365

## Shared Responsibility Model

The shared responsibility model ensures cloud workloads are run securely and in a well-managed way.
Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider will have responsibility over some aspects and the customer will
have responsibility over the other.
