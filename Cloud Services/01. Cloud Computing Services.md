# Cloud Computing Services

There are three main types of cloud computing services,

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Most basic type of category of cloud services
- In IaaS, IT infrastructure such as servers, virtual machines, network, storage, and operating systems are rented from the cloud service provider.

With IaaS
	- there is no upfront cost,
	- the user is responsible for purchasing, configuring, and managing their own operating systems, middlewares, and applications.

IaaS usage
	- Migrating workloads (move existing apps to the cloud)
	- Deploying test and development environments (quicker deployment of applications)
	- website hosting (easier and economical)
	- storage, backup, and recovery (saves money, scalable, no need for IT staff to manage)

## Shared Responsibility Model

The shared responsibility model ensures cloud workloads are run securely and in a well-managed way.
Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider will have responsibility over some aspects and the customer will
have responsibility over the other.
