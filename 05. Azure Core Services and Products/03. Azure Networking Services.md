# Azure Networking Services 

Azure Networking services allows you to connect the cloud and on-premise infrastructure and services to provide users with best possible experiences.

## Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

- enables secure communication for Azure resources (such as VMs) between each other, the Internet, and on-premise networks.
- VNets are usually scoped to a single region, but multiple VNets in different regions can be connected using virtual network peering.
- provides isolation, segmentation, communication between cloud and on-premise environments, and routing and filtering of network traffic.

## Azure Load Balancer

- provides scale for your applications and high availability for your services.
- can work with both inbound and outbound traffic to provide low latency and high throughputs.
- supports both TCP and UDP protocols
- can be used for incoming Internet traffic, traffic between Azure services, traffic that requires port forwarding, and external connectivity for VMs in your VNet.

## Virtual Private Network Gateway

- provides an encrypted connection between an Azure VNet and an on-premise network over the public Internet.
- it is a secure way to connect the cloud and on-premise networks over the Internet.

## Azure Application Gateway

- web application load balancer that manages traffic to your web app.
- users connect to web app through this.
- it can route traffic based on source IP address and port number to destination IP address and port number.
- can secure web app by configuring web application firewalls, redirection, and session affinity to keep the user on the same server.

## Content Delivery Network

- it is a distributed network of servers that is used to efficiently deliver web content to users.
- used to deliver content to users in their local regions to reduce latency times.
- data can be cached at strategically placed physical nodes around the world to provide better performance.
- typically used for servers hosting multimedia content or events that require high bandwidth.
