# Azure Compute

- Azure compute is an on-demand computing service that can be used to run cloud-based applications.
- It provides compute resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking, and operating systems.
- The most common compute services are virtual machines and containers.

**What is a virtual machine?**-*A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer. It includes a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. VMs host an operating system and allows you to install and run software on it as you would on a normal computer.*

## Azure Virtual Machines

- Azure virtual machines is an IaaS offering that allow you to create virtual machines in the Azure cloud. 
- It is ideal when you need control over the operating system and the environment.

## Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets allow you to deploy and manage multiple identical virtual machines.
- No pre-provisioning of virtual machines is required.
- Makes it easy to build large scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized application workloads.
- As workload demand increases more VMs can be added, and as workload is reduced VMs can be removed from the pool. This can be done manually, automatically, or as a combination of both.

## App Services

- App Function is a PaaS offering that allows you to build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps easily. 
- You can meet performance, security, scalability, and compliance requirements while using a fully managed platform to run your applications.

## Functions

- Functions are desirable when you only have to care about the code that needs to run and not any of the other underlying infrastructures. 
- They are useful to perform work in response to an event (REST API call), timer, or even a message from an Azure service.
