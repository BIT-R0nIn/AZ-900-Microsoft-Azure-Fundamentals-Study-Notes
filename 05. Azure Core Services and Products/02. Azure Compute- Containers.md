## Containers

Containers are an excellent choice if you want to run multiple instances of an application on the same host machine. The container orchestrator can easily start, stop, and scale out application instances as needed.

Containers are a virtualization environment
- containers reference the operating system of a host environment that runs the container.
- unlike VMs, there is no need to manage the operating systems.
- containers are lightweight and are designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically.
- containers allow you to respond to changes on demand and restart in case of a crash or a hardware malfunction.
- Azure supports Docker

**Container vs Virtual machines**

- VMs virtualize the hardware while containers virtualize the operating system
- VMs offer more control over the environment than containers
- containers are more portable, lightweight, and has better performance than VMs

- Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a PaaS offering that allows you to run containers on the cloud. 
- You can upload your containers to the cloud and ACI can run them for you.

## Azure Kubernetes Service

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers. 
- Orchestration is the task of automating, interacting, and managing a large number of containers.

**What is a microservice?**
Microservices are a way to simplify the architecture of an application by focusing on creating smaller, more manageable, autonomous, and independently deployed services. 

### Usage of containers in solutions

- Containers often follow the microservice architecture for solutions. This includes splitting up the solutions into simpler smaller ones. 
- For example, a web site can be split to create 3 containers- the front end, the back end, and for storage. This split allows you to logically separate your application, where each piece can be updated, scaled, or maintained separately. 


### Migrate applications to containers

You can migrate existing applications to containers and run them in Azure Kubernetes Service. You can also control access to AKS via Azure Active Directory and use OSBA (Open Source Broker for Azure) to connect to SLA-backed Azure services such as Azure Database for MySQL to the AKS cluster.
