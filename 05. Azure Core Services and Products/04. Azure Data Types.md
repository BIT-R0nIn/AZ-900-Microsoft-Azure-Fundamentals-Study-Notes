# Azure Data Categories

There are three data categories,
1. Structured Data
2. Semi-structured Data
3. Unstructured Data

## Structured Data

- adheres to a schema. All data has the same fields & properties
- can be stored in a database table using rows & columns
- keys are used to define the relationship between one row of table to another row of another table.
- also called relational data. The scheme defines the table of data, the fields of the table, & the clear relationship between the two
- easy to enter, query, & analyze because all data follow the same format
- example: sensor data, financial data

## Semi-structured Data

- less organized than structured data
- data is not stored in relational format (fields do not neatly fit into the tables, rows, & columns)
- contains tags to make the organization and hierarchy apparent
- also called non-relational or NoSQL data 
- example: books, blogs, HTML documents

## Unstructured Data

- does not have an organized structure
- can store any kind of data
- is becoming more prominent as businesses try to tap into new data sources
- example: PDF file, audio file, video movie
