# Tags

- tags are applied to your Azure resources giving metadata to logically organize them into a taxonomy
- each tag consists of a name and a value pair
- you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value
- they also enable you to retrieve related resources from different resource groups

## Limitations

- not all resources support tagging
- each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 50 tag name/value pairs
- tag name is limited to 512 characters while the tag value can hold 256 characters (For storage accounts, the tag name is limited to 128 characters, and the tag value is limited to 256 characters.)
- VMs and VM Scale Sets have a 2048 character limit for both tag name and value
- Tags applied to resource groups are not inherited to the resources within.
