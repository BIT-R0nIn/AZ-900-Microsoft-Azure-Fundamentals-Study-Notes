# Monitoring Applications and Services

- data monitoring is useful because it improves visibility of the operations in your computing environment
- Azure Monitor provides valuable insights into your applications, and other resources they depend on
- The features of Azure Monitor can be divided into 4 categories
1. **Analyze**
2. **Respond**
3. **Visualize**
4. **Integrate**

## Analyze

***Application Insights***
- monitors availability, performance, and usage of web applications.
- supports both cloud-hosted or on-prem applications
- provides deeper insights by leveraging the data obtained from Log Analytics
- can diagnose errors without waiting for a user to report them

***Azure Monitor for Containers***
- designed to monitor the performance of container workloads, which are deployed to managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services 
- gives you performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics available in Kubernetes through the metric API

***Azure Monitor for VMs***
- monitors Azure VMs at scale, by analyzing the performance and health
- monitors the interconnected processors and dependent resources of the virtual machines as well
- includes support for monitoring performance and application dependencies of on-premise VMs, and VMs hosted in other cloud service providers

## Respond

***Alerts***
- proactively notifies you of critical conditions
- can potentially attempt to take corrective actions
- Alert rules based on metrics can provide alerts in almost real-time, based on numeric values
- rules based on logs allow for complex logic across data, from multiple sources

***Autoscale***
- ensures that you have the right amount of resources running to manage the load on your application effectively
- enables you to create rules that use metrics, collected by Azure Monitor, to determine when to automatically add resources to handle increases in load
- help reduce your Azure costs by removing resources that are not being used

## Visualize

***Dashboards***
***Views***
***Power BI***

## Integrate

- Other Azure services can be integrated with Azure Monitor to build customized solutions that use your monitoring data.
