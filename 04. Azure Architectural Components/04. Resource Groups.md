- A resource group is a management unit for your resources in Azure. 
- It acts as a container that holds all the components of your application.
- It allows you to manage all these components as a single unit rather than managing them individually.

The following resources can be applied & managed at a resource group level:
- metering & billing
- policies
- monitoring & alerts
- quotes
- access control

**Logical grouping** - Resource groups allow us to organize & manage resources in Azure. Resources can be grouped according to their usage, type, or even region.

**Life Cycle** - Deleting a resource group will delete all the resources that it holds. This is useful to remove multiple resources at once. Grouping resources according to their life cycles also has their benefits since one could easily get rid of a testing environment by deleting its resource group

**Authorization** - Role-based Access Control (RBAC) can be applied to resource groups to ease administration & provide access limitations. 


Resource groups can be created using the following,

- Azure Portal
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- Azure SDKs (.Net, Java)
- Templates

When using resource groups in your organization,

- Use proper & consistent naming (name should give an idea on what the resource group is about)
- organize resource groups according to needs

Resources can be grouped within resource groups in below ways

1. organization according to resource type - resources of the same type can have their own resource group

2. organization according to environment - resources can be grouped according to the environments they will be deployed in (eg: resources used in production environments in one resource group and testing resources in another)

5. organization according to authorization needs - resources can be organized according to access settings. 

6. organization according to life cycle - temporary projects can be organized into a single resource group so it can be deleted easily when the project is finished.

7. organization according to usage in billing reports - placing resources in a resource group is a way to group them according to usage in billing reports. This can offer us an insight how costs are distributed within the Azure environment.
