## Azure Architectural Components

# Regions

- Microsoft Azure is made out of datacentres interconnected all over the globe.
- These datacentres are organized and made available to end users by regions.
- A region is a geographical location on the planet with at least one, but potentially multiple datacentres in close proximity and connected using a low-latency network.
- Microsoft has stated that Azure has 60 regions in 140 countries around the world.

 - Azure has the highest number of global regions compared to other cloud providers.
 - Azure provides customers with flexibility and scale to bring applications closer to their users.
 - Preserves data residency, comprehensive compliance, and data resiliency options.
 - Customers can choose where applications will be deployed by selecting a region.
 - Data remains within the same geographical region (except for Brazil-South) for tax and legal jurisdiction purposes.

# Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography within 300 miles (when possible).
- The 'Brazil-South' region is the only region with its pair outside of its geography.

 - When possible Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacentres in a regional pair to minimize the likelihood of an event (natural disasters, man-made disasters, civil unrest, physical network outages etc.) affecting both regions. (**Physical Isolation**)
 - Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provides automatic replication to the paired region. (**Platform-provided replication**)
 - In case of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized over the other. (**Regional Recovery Order**)
 - Updates are rolled out to regions in a regional pair sequentially to minimize downtime, logical errors, and bad updates.
 - Having a broadly distributed datacentre network allows Azure to provide a high degree of availability.
