# Azure Geographical Components

## Regions

- Microsoft Azure is made out of datacentres interconnected all over the globe.
- These datacentres are organized and made available to end users by regions.
- A region is a geographical location on the planet with at least one, but potentially multiple datacentres in close proximity and connected using a low-latency network.
- Microsoft has stated that Azure has 60 regions in 140 countries around the world.

 - Azure has the highest number of global regions compared to other cloud providers.
 - Azure provides customers with flexibility and scale to bring applications closer to their users.
 - Preserves data residency, comprehensive compliance, and data resiliency options.
 - Customers can choose where applications will be deployed by selecting a region.
 - Data remains within the same geographical region (except for Brazil-South) for tax and legal jurisdiction purposes.

## Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography within 300 miles (when possible).
- The 'Brazil-South' region is the only region with its pair outside of its geography.

 - When possible Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacentres in a regional pair to minimize the likelihood of an event (natural disasters, man-made disasters, civil unrest, physical network outages etc.) affecting both regions. (**Physical Isolation**)
 - Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provides automatic replication to the paired region. (**Platform-provided replication**)
 - In case of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized over the other. (**Regional Recovery Order**)
 - Updates are rolled out to regions in a regional pair sequentially to minimize downtime, logical errors, and bad updates. (**Sequential Updates**)
 - Having a broadly distributed datacentre network allows Azure to provide a high degree of availability.

## Geographies

- Azure divides the world into 'geographies' based on geopolitical boundaries and country borders.
- A geography is a discrete market that contains two or more regions that preserve data residency and compliance boundaries.

Benefits of geographies,
- allow users with specific data residency and compliance needs to keep their data and applications close.
- ensure that data residency, compliance, sovereignty, and resiliency requirements are honoured within a geography.
- provide fault tolerance to withstand total region failure by using dedicated and high capacity network connections.

**What is data residency?**
*Data residency refers to the physical or geographical location that data is stored. It defines the legal and regulatory requirements that are imposed on the data within that specific region*

The Azure geographies are,
- Americas
- Europe
- Asia Pacific
- Middle East and Africa
