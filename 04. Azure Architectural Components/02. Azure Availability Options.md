# Availability Options

- A single virtual machine with premium storage has an SLA of 99.9% and can be quickly migrated as-is to Azure through 'lift-and-shift' which is a code-free method that migrates application as-is, providing the benefits of cloud without the risks or costs of changing code.

- By placing virtual machines into an availability set you protect them against datacenter failure and increase the SLA to 99.5%

- Availability zones protect against total datacenter failures and increase the SLA to 99.99% which is the highest level of protection provided.

- For multi-region disaster rcovery, region pairs protect and provide data residency boundaries.
