## Availability Sets

Availability sets are a way to ensure that your applications remain online in the event of a high-impact maintenance update or hardware failure.

Availability sets are made put of **update domains** and **fault domains**.

***Update Domains***- Update domains are a logical section within the datacentre. When a maintenance event occurs, it's sequenced across these update domains. This ensures that the entire datacentre is not unavailable during updating or patching. 

***Fault domains***- Fault domains are used to separate workloads physically across different hardware (power,cooling, and networking etc.) in a server rack within the datacentre. If a hardware component supporting the server rack were to fail, only that server rack will be affected.

## Availability Zones

- Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region.
- Comprise of availability sets to provide a higher degree of availability and fault tolerance.
- Each zone consists of one or more datacentres.
- Each datacentre is equipped with its own independent power, cooling, and network hardware.
- If one zone goes down, the others continue working.
- zones are connected using very fast, and private fiber optic media.
- allows customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.
- to ensure resiliency a minimum of three zones are present in all enabled regions. 

Azure services that support Availability Zones fall into two categories:
1. Zonal services- resources need to be pinned to the zone (VMs,managed disks, IP addresses etc.)
2. Zone-redundant services- platform replicates automatically across zones (zone redundant storage, SQL databases)
