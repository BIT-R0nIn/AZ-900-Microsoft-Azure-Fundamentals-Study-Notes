## Availability Sets

Availability sets are a way to ensure that your applications remain online in the event of a high-impact maintenance update or hardware failure.

Availability sets are made put of **update domains** and **fault domains**.

***Update Domains***- Update domains are a logical section within the datacentre. When a maintenance event occurs, it sequenced across these update domains. This ensures that the entire datacentre is not unavailable during updating or patching. 

***Fault domains***- Fault domains are used to separate workloads physically across different hardware (power,cooling, and networking etc.) in a server rack within the datacentre. If a hardware component supporting the server rack were to fail, only that server rack will be affected.
