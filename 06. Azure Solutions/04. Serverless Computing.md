# Serverless Computing

- serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment
- no infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed
- you simply create an instance and add your code
- serverless apps respond to events
- an event can be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message from an Azure service. The app runs only when it is triggered
- scaling and performance is handled automatically and you are only billed for the exact resources you use (very cost effective)

Common serverless computing services by Azure are,
1. Azure Functions
2. Azure Logic Apps
3. Azure Event Grid

## Azure Functions

- ideal when you are only considered about the code and not the underlying infrastructure
- commonly used to do work that respond to events and when that work needs to done quickly (in a matter of seconds or less)
- scale automatically and charges are accrued only when the function is triggered (ideal when the demand factor is variable)
- Stateless. They behave as if they are restarted when responding to each event (ideal for processing incoming data)
- if state is required Azure Functions can be connected to a storage service

## Azure Logic Apps

- helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations
- Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions for app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) communication, whether in the cloud, on premises, or both
- Logic Apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code

## Azure Event Grid

- allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures
- it's a fully managed, intelligent event routing service that uses a publish-subscribe model for uniform event consumption
- has built-in support for events coming from Azure services, such as storage blobs and resource groups
- provides support to your own non-Azure-based events in near-real time, using custom topics
- you can use filters to route specific events to different endpoints, and ensure your events are reliably delivered
