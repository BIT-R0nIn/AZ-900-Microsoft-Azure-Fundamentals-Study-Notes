# Internet of Things (IoT)

- the Internet allows any item that's online capable to access valuable information
- The Internet of Things (IoT) is the ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis.
- two core Azure solutions for IoT is the Azure IoT Central and Azure IoT Hub.

## IoT Central

- it is a fully managed global IoT software as a service (SaaS) solution
- it makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your manage your IoT assets to scale
- no cloud computing expertise is required to use it, you can bring you services to the market faster

## IoT Hub

- it is a fully managed service hosted in the cloud
- acts as the central hub for bidirectional communication between the IoT application and the devices it manages
- can also be used to build Azure IoT solutions providing secure & reliable communications between millions of IoT devices and back-end cloud hosted application
- supports multiple messaging patterns such as device-to-cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, and request-reply methods to control your devices from the cloud
- provides monitoring to track the health of your IoT solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections

***Azure IoT Central is a software as a service (SaaS) solution that uses a model-based approach to help you to build enterprise-grade IoT solutions without requiring expertise in cloud-solution development.***

***Azure IoT solution accelerators are an enterprise-grade collection of solution accelerators built on Azure platform as a service (PaaS) that help you accelerate the development of custom IoT solutions.***
