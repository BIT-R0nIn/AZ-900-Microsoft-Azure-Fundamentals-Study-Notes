# Exploring Artificial Intelligence
 
- The core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), in the context of cloud computing, refers to a broad range of services, the core of which is Machine Learning
- Machine Learning (ML) is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends

## Azure Cognitive Services

- collection of domain-specific pre-trained AI models that can be customized with your data
- they are categorized broadly into vision, speech, language, and search
- vision allows apps & services to accurately analyze and identify data within images and videos
- speech services can convert spoken language into text, or produce natural-sounding speech from text using standard (or customizable) voice fonts
- language services can understand the meaning of unstructured text or recognize the speakerâ€™s intent
- knowledge services create rich knowledge resources that integrate into apps and services
- search services enable apps and services to harness the power of a web-scale, ad-free search engine

## Azure Machine Learning Service

- provides a cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models
- fully supports open-source technologies (allows use of libraries such as TensorFlow & sci-kit learn)
- provides support to rich tools that makes it easy to interactively explore & transform data (ex: Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code Tools for AI)
- includes features that automate model generation and tuning,s so it can auto-generate a model and auto-tune it for you
