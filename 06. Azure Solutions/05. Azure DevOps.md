Azure DevOps Services
- allows you to create, build, and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications

Some of the main DevOps services available with Azure are Azure DevOps Services, and Azure DevTest Labs

## Azure DevTest Labs

- helps developers and testers quickly create environments in Azure, while minimizing waste and controlling costs
- users can test their latest application versions by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts
- easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments
- you can scale up your load testing by provisioning multiple test agents and create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos
